# RabbitMQ
RabbitMQ:

RabbitMQ is an open-source general-purpose message-broker software â€“ an intermediary for messaging, 
that initially implemented the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol

RabbitMQ can deal with some high-throughput use cases, such as online transactions or payment processing. 
It is generally used to handle background and cron jobs or as a message broker between microservices.

Apache Kafka is designed for publish-subscribe and streaming scenarios, 
while RabbitMQ is designed for message queuing and routing.

can send 4k-10k messages per second

# Types
Direct Exchange: The direct exchange routes messages to queues based on a routing key that matches the exact routing key of the message. Messages are delivered to the queue(s) that have a binding with a matching routing key.

Fanout Exchange: The fanout exchange routes messages to all the queues that are bound to it, regardless of the routing key. It is useful for broadcasting messages to multiple consumers.

Topic Exchange: The topic exchange routes messages to one or more queues based on a pattern matching the routing key. The routing key is composed of one or more words separated by dots, and queues can bind with a pattern that matches the routing key.

Headers Exchange: The headers exchange routes messages based on matching the headers of the message to the headers of the bindings. This exchange is useful when routing is based on multiple header values, instead of routing keys.

# Real time use case
RabbitMQ is often used for reliable message queuing and routing scenarios, such as:

Order processing: A company may use RabbitMQ to handle customer orders and route them to the appropriate 
department for processing.

Email delivery: Email providers can use RabbitMQ to queue outgoing emails and ensure that they are delivered reliably.

Chat applications: RabbitMQ can be used to handle real-time chat messages in applications, 
ensuring that messages are delivered in the correct order and without loss.
